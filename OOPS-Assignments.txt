Assignment 1:

Vehicle:(Parent)
- create two abstract methods  - run() and stop()
- create three methods of public void fuel - 1st method will take int / 2nd method will float and string  / 3rd method will take char and int (method overloading)
- declare two variables - int speed and long distance
- create two constructors also- default and parameterized

2W:
- override the two methods - run() and stop()
- create default constructor
- declare two variables - int speed and long distance with different values from the parent vehicle
- declare one more variable as int num_of_tire = 2
- create methods here also as display() --> this will print the three variables of 2W  + all the variable of the parent Vehicle  (hint: super.variable_name)

3W:
- override the two methods - run() and stop()
- - create default constructor
- declare two variables - int speed and long distance with different values from the parent vehicle
- declare one more variable as int num_of_tire = 3
- create methods here also as display() --> this will print the three variables of 3W  + all the variable of the parent Vehicle

4W:
- override the two methods - run() and stop()
- create default constructor
- declare two variables - int speed and long distance with different values from the parent vehicle
- declare one more variable as int num_of_tire = 4
- create methods here also as display() --> this will print the three variables of 4W  + all the variable of the parent Vehicle

8W:
- override the two methods - run() and stop()
- create default constructor
- declare two variables - int speed and long distance with different values from the parent vehicle
- declare one more variable as int num_of_tire = 8
- create  methods here also as display() --> this will print the three variables of 8W  + all the variable of the parent Vehicle

  Main()
  - call all the methods using dynamic/runtime polymorphism here
  - all the methods of all the child classes.
  - call all the methods of the fuel of Vehicle class

=================================================================================================
Assignment 2:

(Parent) MNC ---> 2 abstract methods + 1 constructor + 1 normal method

Infosys (child of MNC) ----> make it abstract also  but give the implementation of single abstract method

Hello (child of Infosys) ----> here implement all the abstract methods + 1 create normal method also

main class ---> call all the methods of all classes using the dynamic polymorphism

================================================================================================

Assignment 3:
1) Create an abstract class pen with methods write () and refill () as abstract methods 
2) Use the pen class from Q1 to create a concrete class fountain pen with additional method change Nib ()
3) Create a class monkey with jump ( ) and bite ( ) methods Create a class human which inherits this monkey class and implements basic animal interface with eat ( ) and sleep methods 
4) Demonstrate polymorphism using using monkey  class from Q3 

=================================================================================================

Assignment 4:
Create a class telephone with ( ) , lift ( ) and disconnected ( ) methods as abstract methods create another class smart telephone and demonstrate polymorphism 

=================================================================================================

Assignment 5:
Create an interface TVremote and use it to inherit another interface smart TVremote 
Create a class TV which implements TVremote interface from Q6
